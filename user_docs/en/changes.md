### Changes for Developers

* Changed keyboard typing echo configuration from boolean to integer values:
  * `keyboard.speakTypedCharacters` and `keyboard.speakTypedWords` now use integer values (0=Off, 1=On, 2=Only in edit controls) instead of boolean values in `configSpec.py`.
  * Added `TypingEcho` enum in `config.configFlags` to represent these modes.
  * Updated `speech.speakTypedCharacters()`, keyboard commands and settings dialog to use the new enum. (#xxxxx)
